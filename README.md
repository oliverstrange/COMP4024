# Fetch

![](Resources/GameImage.png)

An playful 2D platformer made using Unity game engine and written using C#.

In this game, your main goal is to retreive the ball, at the other end of the map and bring it back to your fetch robot, as quickly as possible. You do all this will exploring fun maps, avoiding deathly traps and defeating dangerous enemies.

## Team members

The team consisted of six members:

- Oliver Strange
- Conrad (Pak Mok)
- Ibrahim Atomanson
- Rebecca Wallis Downham
- Ragnar (Feiyang Chai)
- Gabriel Cowan

## Unity engine

This game was developed using version 2021.3.18f1 of the Unity editor.

## Testing

For our project we decided to carry out both Test Driven Development and Beta Testing. 

TDD allows the development phase to be more efficient and also helped us to find issues in our code at an early stage, this is beneficial becausse if we did not do this, multiple bugs could build up and they would be harder to find.

Beta Testing allows us developers to prioritise customer/user opinnion, we can gain vital feeback to help improve our game , further more we can identify new bugs us developers may not as when we play the game, we may think differently to the users.

Here you can find links to both the [Unit Test Plan](Resources/Unit%20Test%20plan-2.pdf) and [Beta Testing Report](Resources/Beta%20Testing%20COMP%204024.pdf).
